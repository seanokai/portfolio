			<p> Odds are either one of my links are broken or your keyboard cunningly wanted to see if I had designed my <b>404 page</b>. Well I did! I always am prepared. I you wish to navigate to the works page, just hit the "Works" tab to go back or <a href="index.html">click here.</a>

			</p>	

			<p> That should redirect you to my home page again. Sorry for the inconvenience, happy browsing.</p>
