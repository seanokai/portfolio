							<b>The Holtz Spa</b> â€” an escape for the body and mind believes that the elimination of stress and tension is critical to
							the improvement and maintenance of overall health and well being.</p>

							<p class="piece-text">
							The logo was designed to give the feel of wholesomeness and care, an attribute emulated by the company.
							Curvature was a fundamental element in the design of the logo which communicated the sense of flexibility and flow.
							We added an outlined stroke to give the logo a firm support while standing on its own, this created a strong and bold logo
							that could both stand by itself or be paired with a host of informative text. Overall the design came out great!
