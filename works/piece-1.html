							The Holtz SPA logo has been designed to give the wholesome feel of care and expertise that is emulated by the company, furthermore to communicate a strong visual image , as well as an intrinsic identity to the company of Holtz SPA.

Curvature was a fundamental element in the design  of the logo. Its appearance can be seen on multiple surfaces propelling it to achieve much more than a normal logo. More printing options, different material packaging; this logo can manage and appear professionaly on many surfaces whilst keeping an overall stationary design.

Reproduction and reduction of the Holts SPA logo still reads and communicates well, even at a very small size. The weight of the curved lines suggest the absence of stress and knots; a representation of both the services and staff at the Holtz SPA.
