							Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela; 18 July 1918 – 5 December 2013) was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, politician, and philanthropist who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black chief executive, and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid through tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial reconciliation. Politically an African nationalist and democratic socialist, he served as President of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997. Internationally, Mandela was Secretary General of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999.

							Designing a piece that really communicated a true leader in every aspect was difficult. One thing I could not leave out were the many ways people respected throught different medium. The most popular; a hand balled up to a fist to show strength in solidarity. A truely favorite piece of mine.
