							The Quotes of life draws inpsiration from the many great leaders who once lived; stating their words as a way of life. I decided that to really communicate the idea. I had to have huge contrasts. Hence why I used candles to illuminate a dark room. After taking pictures of just the candles, I imported them into indesign where I added text to them. I also produced a booklet for this design.
