							The second biggest and most recognized derby in the english premier league. As a gooner myself, I could not sit still as soon as the whistle went off. It was only right to animate one of the most thrilling times of my life; each year. I decided to use illustrator to sketch out all my designs, then i transfered them to cinema 4d where I beveled it and animated it.
