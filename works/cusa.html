														<b>The CUSA Interactive TouchScreen</b> is a one stop directory connecting all the students to their favorite activity,
														sport, event, school bar or even class buildings. It gives the student the knowledge of the whole school without having to walk around it.
														Working on this project was cool! I got to handle the designing of high touch point icons and various mapping design enquiries. Special attention to detail made this
														project even more interesting as you could't afford to miss place an important piece. Upon presentation to the CUSA Board, they were ecstatic
														and couldn't wait to unveil it to the students.
