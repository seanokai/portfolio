				<b>The Palm View Finder</b> is an application that puts the power of real-time movie scene selection in the palm of your hands.
				From having the ability to save scene locations to picking the correct lens for a particular job, be confident where you find yourself.
				I designed the UI and UX for this application with the movie maker in mind. With icons that look simple but instructive this makes sure
				the user can keep up with the action wihtout fumbling to press the correct button. Know instantly.
