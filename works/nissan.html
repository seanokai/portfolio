							<b>Dormani Nissan</b> worked with us to create graphics and advertise their new cars including the Rogue 2018 and others for sale.
							Many of those graphics had size restrictions which made certain scenarios interesting when designing. The vehicle took up half of the main focal point which left big informational text to take up the rest.
							Only thing left was to bake in the customers colours and branding into the design and we were off to the races.
						Feedback from the customer was nothing but positive. The materials were used on their website and many other affiliate sites to go-live on their scheduled advertising dates.</p>
